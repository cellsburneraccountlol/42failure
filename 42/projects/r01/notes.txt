Check Inputs
get inputs from command line, and input check for inputs 1<=x<=4 , and that is also in specified 
format of "x y z ..." , there should be 16 inputs , max 1 '4' , and 4 '1's

Init Board

Inputs are linked to a cell on the edges of the 4*4 , if the input is 1 , set the value of the cell to 4 

Lookfor4ve
Look for 4 in the first 8 inputs , if there is a 4 in the first 4 print 1-4 straight down, 
if there is a 4 in the second set of 4 inputs print upwards (starting from closest cell) 

Lookfor4ho
If there is 4 in the 3rd set if 4 inputs, print horizontal 1-4 straight , 
4 in last set of 4 inputs, print 1-4 backwards (starting from closest cell)
